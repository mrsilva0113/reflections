How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff allowed me to see the line that changed, even if it was only one character change.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having previous versions allow you to undo changes and see how the code logic has changed over time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Better to choice when to commit changes reasonable significant changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Committing multiple files makes it easier to track changes for the whole respository.  Google Docs is meant to be a word processor not a code editor.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log comments give you a summary of what has changed.  Diff shows the actual changes that were made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Changes are more likely to introduce bugs than not.  Version control makes it easier to see what changed.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use git for exactly what it was buit for to have version control over my coding projects.
